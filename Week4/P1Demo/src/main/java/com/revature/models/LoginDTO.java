//What the HECK is a DTO? Data Transfer Object. A DTO is just a model of some data coming from the client.
//your servlet will parse a JSON object sent by the user, containing their username and password, 
//which gets sent to the controller to be turned into a Java object
//The username and password will be put into this DTO as fields, which will get checked/validated by the service layer
//you NEVER store a DTO in the database. It's purely for data transfer... Data Transfer Object
