	//Below is boilerplate code--- We'll talk about it more later but for now, 
	//These are overridden methods from the Object class (the root class of all classes). 
	//they give our Objects certain functionality! Which we'll talk about below
	
	//it looks scary but we can autogenerate it all with alt + shift + s (or the source tab).
	
	
	//Remember, constructors let you instantiate an object (initialize an object with their variables)
	
	//no-args constructor (so you can make a pokemon with no name or type)


	//all-args constructor (so you can make a pokemon with all its values)


	//the toString() method lets you do String-like stuff with your objects, like print them out
	//otherwise you'd just get a random String of characters that represent the object's location in memory


	//remember what hashcodes are?? They basically assign a unique identifier to each object you create


	//equals lets you compare objects to one another via their hashcode
	//Java is like - "are these objects the same object? Compare their hashcodes to check"

	
	//getters and setters let you get the value of private fields, and set the values of private fields, respectively.
	//THIS IS CALLED ENCAPSULATAION!!! Good practice for security, when you don't want values messed with directly
